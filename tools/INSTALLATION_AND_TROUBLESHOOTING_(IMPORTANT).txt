I. Rename the .yyz file before importing the project to GameMaker. This is important, or
else there will be save and config files conflicts with other projects using Orbinaut
that kept the default name

II. Orbinaut Framework uses a custom GameMaker effect to provide distortion effects.
If you don't have it installed, the project will work fine without it but you
won't be able to use / see it in your compiled game

This doesn't affect the playable build provided with the release, because it is already compiled
with the effect installed on our end!

To install the effect, please, go to:
WINDOWS: C:/ProgramData/GameMakerStudio2/Cache/runtimes/(latest_runtime)/bin/FiltersAndEffects
MACOS: Users/Shared/GameMakerStudio2/Cache/runtimes/(latest_runtime)/bin/FiltersAndEffects

and put the _filter_waves folder here. Please note the each time GameMaker 
runtime is updated, you have to re-install the effect!

III. Possible launch issues:
- Launching the build resulting in "can't read byte" error: remove the OrbinautFramework folder from AppData -> Local
- Unable to launch the game from GameMaker (can't open file error): launch GameMaker with Admin permissions

IV. Playable Build FAQ

Q: I can't use Game Start, it results in a message that stage is unable to load!
A: You aren't supposed to use Game Start. This is the build of how the framework itself is provided
(i.e. for those who don't have GameMaker installed). Please, use Scene Select

Q: Am I able to toggle various features that were noted in About section?
A: No, that's only possible with the project itself.
